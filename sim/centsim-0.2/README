README for Centipede/Millipede Simulator
Release 0.02  8/20/94
Copyright 1994 Eric L. Smith

New features in this release:

  Centipede ROM image no longer needs to be patched.
  Centipede self-test mode now works.
  Millipede colors now work.

Needs Atari ROM images, not supplied, which should be placed in a subdirectory
named "roms"

How to build:

  xmkmf -a
  make

How to run:

  sim           # small window
  sim -x2 -y3   # large window

How to play:

  Keep the X cursor in the game window (or the keyboard won't work).  The title
  bar of the window is convenient as it doesn't matter if it is obscured.

  use "1" or "2" key to start a one or two player game
  use cursor keys to move shooter
  use space key to fire  

Options:

  -x<n>  scale pixels up horizontally by <n>
  -y<n>  scale pixels up vertically by <n>
  -i<n>  update display every <n>th interrupt (4 on real hardware, default is 16)
  c      play Centipede (default)
  m      play Millipede

Known bugs:

1.  Should allow ROM image location to be provided on command line or via
    an environment variable.

2.  Should simulate EEPROM using a file.

3.  Should I try to hold the keyboard focus even if X cursor is not in the
    window?

4.  Millipede option switches and other inputs such as self test are not yet
    implemented.

5.  Need to simulate the trackball instead of the joystick.  Millipede doesn't
    seem to sample the joystick input frequently enough.

6.  Need to implement a different color strategy instead of allocating planes,
    so that Millipede doesn't have to use a private color map.

7.  Needs sound!  Write to /dev/audio?  Use a second process?

8.  Needs general event-scheduling mechanism to replace current interrupt and
    VBL handling.

9.  Need to simulate watchdog timer in order to allow switching in and out of
    self-test mode at run time.
